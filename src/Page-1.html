                  <p class="u-text u-text-3">My two favorite things to do in this world are to sing and dance. Watching "Dirty Dancing" for the first time at the age of three sparked my love for dance. Ever since I can remember, I've always loved choreographing dance numbers in my room and belting out ballads in the shower. I love breaking out into dance in the kitchen or living room and Rob is always right there with me, joining in with his goofy moves. Other hobbies of mine include community fitness, painting furniture, hiking, riding bikes, going to the beach, reading books, and baking.&nbsp;</p>

                  <p class="u-text u-text-2">Jenn and I first met when we were 16 years old at a sweet 16 party of a mutual friend. Jenn is so kind, silly, goofy, but also level-headed. She always tries to see things from another person's point of view. After 17 years with Jenn, through all the good times and bad times, I can honestly say she is the most kindhearted, amazing person I know. I know Jenn will be a great mother. As a teacher, she's built relationships with and cared for many children. One of Jenn's greatest strengths is supporting others with honesty, love and understanding. I know she'll care for our child in the same way.</p>

                  <p class="u-text u-text-3">I have always been pretty easy-going. I enjoy the simple pleasures of family, good friends, tasty food, and the sound of the wind in the trees. I wanted to be a scientist or an artist when I was younger, and now, I do a bit of both as a Computer Programmer. When I'm not working, I like to hike, go on bike rides, tend to the garden, and read books in our hammock. I also like to take our dog on car rides to the beach and watch his joy at the outside world. I love being an uncle and I become a big kid when I play with children. We have close friends who have a 2-year-old daughter and playing with her makes me realize how much I look forward to being a dad.</p>

                  <h3 class="u-custom-font u-font-playfair-display u-text u-text-2">Jenn's perspective</h3>
                  <p class="u-text u-text-3">As a child who was adopted, I have a personal understanding of what it's like to be a part of a family through love, not blood. I was adopted as an infant in the Bronx, New York by my mother and father. Shortly after, my father passed away and my mother and I moved to Florida and into our own small apartment. We didn't have much but we had each other, and that was all I needed. My mother remarried and I gained a stepfather, who is now my "Dad", and then a sister, who gave me my wish of becoming a big sister.<br>
                    <br>When I was in second grade, my mother shared my adoption story with me. At first, I was confused, however I never felf upset or unloved. Being adopted made me feel special, like I was chosen. I feel that way to this day. Even though I was curious, my birth mother is still unknown to me and I have no resentment towards her. She chose what was best for me and gave me a chance at a loving family. I want this same experience for our child. I want him or her to feel special, chosen, and loved. I feel confident that I will be able to relate to and provide comfort for our child when it comes to questions and feelings regarding his or her adoption.

We don't believe in perfect; we belive in what is real. After being married for 20 years, we know that we are ready to be parents, and adoption is in our hearts. We are ready for the sleepless nights, "terrible twos" and dramatic teens. We have been dreaming of this journey for a long time and the thought of you reading our book right now is an exciting thought for us.<br>
                    <br>Thank you again for taking the time to learn more about us and we would feel honored to meet you.<br>
